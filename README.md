## POLLS Application
This application demonstrates "Shared database with shared schema" principle on managing multi-tenancy applications.  
This principle advocates for a single database that keeps every tenant’s(organization) data. A foreign key in the tables identifies the tenant and seperates the data records ensuring data protection and integrity.
